# advent-of-code-2018
My solutions to the Advent of Code challenge for 2018: https://adventofcode.com/2018/

To solve any of the challenges, navigate to the day of the challenge you'd like to solve and run the following:
```
ruby solution.rb
```
Or the following, replacing the day number, from the project root directory:
```
ruby day01/solution.rb
```

Feedback from the test scenarios will be printed first, followed by the solutions to both parts of the challenge, providing the test scenarios pass.
The solutions for both parts of the challenge will be printed to the terminal:
```
Solution to Part1:
none

Solution to Part2:
none
```
