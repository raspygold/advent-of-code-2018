My solutions to the Advent of Code challenge for 2018: https://adventofcode.com/2018/

To solve any of the challenges, navigate to the day of the challenge you'd like to solve and run the following:
```
ruby solution.rb
```
Or the following, replacing the day number, from the project root directory:
```
ruby day01/solution.rb
```
